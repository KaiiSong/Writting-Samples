## Honour Thesis

### **Optimal Intergenerational Sugar Tax: A Sufficient Statistics Approach**

**Submitted:** 30 October 2025  
**Supervisor:** [Dr Ash Craig](https://www.ashleycraig.com/)  

#### **Elevator Pitch**

Sugar consumption drives multiple health issues, and sugar taxes are debated worldwide.  
My thesis examines the economic foundations and derives the optimal tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB).  

Most existing models stop at a single generation, treating the government as the only agent exercising the correction. But in reality, **parents are also correcting their children’s behaviour** — they provide food, form habits, and care about their children’s welfare. Ignoring parental correction, the SSB tax may not be accurate.  

I created a model where both the **government and parents intervene**; the optimal sugar tax is more than just adjusting parameters. The optimal tax must account for **intergenerational spillovers**, caused by **misperceptions of children’s welfare** and **habit formation**.  

Using a sufficient-statistics framework, I estimate the optimal SSB tax and find that **accounting for intergenerational effects increases the optimal rate from 5.4 % to between 8.8 % – 12.2 %**.

## Special Topics in Economics Coursework Report

### **Decomposing the Gap: Tracing the Sources of Indigenous Income Inequality**

**Submitted:** November 2024  
**Supervisor:** [Professor Bob Gregory](https://rse.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/professor-bob-gregory)  

#### **Description**

This report investigates **Indigenous income inequality** in Australia using limited census data to explore the origins of the “Indigenous pay gap.” Using ABS TableBuilder data, I analyse the role of **employment conditional on education**, highlighting how differences in these factors between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians shape the observed income gap.

## Environmental Mathematics (MATH3133) Coursework Report

### **Sensitivity Analysis and Its Application on the DICE Model**

**Submitted:** November 2023  
**Type:** Semi-independent work  
**Supervisor:** [Professor Barry Croke](https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/barry-croke)

#### **Description**

This literature review focuses on **sensitivity analysis (SA)** within the context of environmental science.  
I examined SA applications to the **Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE)** model, a Nobel-winning framework for climate-economy interactions.  
The essay discusses the **mathematical foundations of SA**, the **structure of the DICE model**, and **key findings from sensitivity analysis** applied to it.
